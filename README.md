This is a solution to the Sunnyside Landing Pahe challenge on Frontend Mentor using React, Tailwind, and TypeScript.
This was also a practive attempt using TypeScript code.

#Challenges face during this project
-How to create a right triangle for the mobile menu using HTML div and CSS
-How to create a custom type and use it to confirm the typing of props passed in a component
-Use object cover on images to have it take up the entire width and height of its containing element

#How I can improve in the future
-Learn more advanced React topics like hooks
-Improve Tailwind code by shortening long series of utlity classes into a single custom class
-Improve basic TypeScript knowledge and coding in TypeScript
-Instead of src/assets/components, do src/assets/sections for different parts of my body because Header.tsx, Footer.tsx, etc. aren't really components. Only 
TestimonialCard.tsx was a real component. 
-Use less divs and use section element more.
-Use >, <, >=, or <= instead of min-width in media queries. 
-Enclose main content in main elements. 
-Use ts instead of tsx when storing data because tsx is better for rendering HTML.
